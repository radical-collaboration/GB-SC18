# GB-SC18

This a collaborative project, just getting underway, that will study a wide range of cancer drugs and candidate ligands in order to support personalised clinical decision making based on genome sequencing and drug discovery, using automated workflows underpinned by ensemble-based high performance computing methods running at unprecedented scales. In order to do this, we are developing the High-Throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HT-BAC) which is the integration of the BAC -- Binding Affinity Calculator -- developed by the Centre for Computational Science at UCL, and RADICAL-Cybertools (from the RADICAL Laboratory at Rutgers University). BAC represents the state-of-the-art in defining biomedically important workflows for rapid, accurate, precise and reliable free energy based binding affinity calculations. RADICAL-Cybertools are a suite of functional components that support the interoperable and scalable execution of multiple simulations.

HT-BAC provides the ability to separate the "setting-up" (i.e., defining) of a workflow from its "execution". The two components (BAC and Ensemble-Toolkit) separate the two concerns. HT-BAC will use well defined Ensemble-Toolkit APIs to support multiple distinct workflows of increasing sophistication. Starting with a "bag -of-tasks" it will evolve to support adaptive sampling. The runtime system of RADICAL-Cybertools (which is known as RADICAL-Pilot) is being engineered to support up to 100,000 ensemble members; successful execution of these calculations also depends on new capabilities in the Open MPI library which fully recognises, for the first time, the importance of running MPI applications comprised of such very large numbers of individual sub-components.

Co-PIs on the project are Peter Coveney (UCL) and Shantenu Jha (Rutgers).
